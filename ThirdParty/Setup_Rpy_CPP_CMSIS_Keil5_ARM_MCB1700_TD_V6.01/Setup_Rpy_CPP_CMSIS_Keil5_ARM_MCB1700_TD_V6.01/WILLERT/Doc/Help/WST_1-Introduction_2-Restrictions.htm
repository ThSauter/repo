<h1><a name="Rectrictions" id="Rectrictions"></a>Product Restrictions</h1>The
Embedded UML RXF is adapted to seamlessly integrate into the
development environment toolchain. This requires several interfaces
that may result in restrictions, which are not caused by the RXF
itself, but also the RXF has some restrictions.<br><br>
<h2><a name="UML_Restrictions" id="UML_Restrictions"><a name="Modelling_Restrictions" id="Modelling_Restrictions"></a>UML Modelling Restrictions</h2>
<p>
Almost all UML elements can be used in Rhapsody in combination with the RXF. This includes classes, objects, singleton objects, files,
statecharts, several kinds of relations etc. However, some UML elements
cannot be used together with C code generation:<br>
<ul>
<li>Activity Diagrams associated to Operations<br>
  Code generation is only supported for activity diagrams and statecharts,
  which are associated with a class, an object or a file. Activity
  diagrams can also be assigned to operations, but no C code can be
  generated from them.
</li>
<li>Ports<br>
  The usable ports are restricted to simple behavioral ports. Through
  these ports it is possible to send events from one object to another
  without a tight coupling meeting defined interfaces.<br>
  It is not recommended to send events through ports from an interrupt
  service routine, as memory will be dynamically allocated in that case.<br>
  Rapid Ports are supported. Multicast ports are not supported and 
  switched of by the framework. Port multiplicity is supported.<br> 
</li>
  <li>Animation<br>
The RXF does not support communication via TCP/IP due to the
heavy overhead. As a consequence there is no support for Rhapsody's internal
feature called "Animation". But a good alternative is to use our animation
feature that allows debugging of real-time applications: The
<a href="WST_1-Introduction_9-UML-Target-Debugger.htm">Embedded UML Target Debugger</a>.
</li>
<li>Inheritance<br>
To allow inheritance in the C language, all operations would need to be
implemented as callbacks or in a virtual function table. This would
increase the code size, RAM needs, runtime and calling operations from
user code would be more complicated. Thus no inheritance is available
in Rhapsody in C.</li>



</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="Target_Debugger_Restrictions" id="Target_Debugger_Restrictions"></a>Embedded UML Target Debugger Restrictions</h2>
<p>
<ul>

<li/>Roundtripping<br/>The current implementation of the WSTMonitor causes restrictions
  regarding code roundtripping. It is planned to solve this issue
  in the near future. The WSTMonitor is required to communicate
  with the Embedded UML Target Debugger.


<li/>Keil UVSOCK Communication from PC to Target<br/>
  
  Currently the Target Debugger monitor part (C++ code on target)
  has problems to receive commands via Keil UVSOCK.
  When used in C++ code, the Keil UVSOCK interface seems to skip
  some bytes during data reception. As a workaround all communication
  from Target Debugger (host) to C++ Monitor (target) is
  deactivated. Several Target Debugger features (e.g. query
  attributes, query states, suspend, set filters and breakpoints)
  are currently not available in the C++ evaluation version.
  We are in contact with Keil and trying to solve this problem
  with the Keil UVSOCK communication interface.
