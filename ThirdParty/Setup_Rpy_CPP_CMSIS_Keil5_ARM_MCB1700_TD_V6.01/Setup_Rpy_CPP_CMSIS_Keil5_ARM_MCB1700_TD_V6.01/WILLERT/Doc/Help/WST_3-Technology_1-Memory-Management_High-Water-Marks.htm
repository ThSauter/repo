All static buffers can be configured via properties, which you can set
in your model. We have implemented high water marks for these so you
can inspect at runtime how much resources of these buffers are actually
used.<br>
  <br>There is a single data field, which you can inspect for the high water marks. This field is a structure that shows:<br>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>the maximum number of buffers used of the small buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of&nbsp;buffers used of the medium buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of&nbsp;buffers used of the large buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of timeouts used of the timeout buffer pool</li>

    <li>a flag that indicates if the heap was used because a buffer pool was exhausted, in the case you enabled a <a href="WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-Management_Deterministic-Realtime-Memory-Usage.htm#Mixed_Mode_Static_and_Dynamic_Memory">mixed mode of static and dynamic memory</a> management.</li>
  </ul>The high water marks allow you to fine-tune the number of elements provided in the static pools.<br>
<br>
They are enabled if <a href="WST_3-Technology_8-List-of-Defines.htm#WST_CFG_HIGHWATERMARKS_Define">WST_CFG_HIGHWATERMARKS</a>
is defined, usually this can be done via the generated file
RxfConstants.h. Then you can add the global structure "highwater" to
your debugger's watch window to analyze the high water marks after a
system has performed the desired tasks.<br>
