\
KNOWN ISSUES\
\f0 \fs16 \
- if you deploy your generated files while you have the simulator or debugger\
  active in uVision, the uVision project file might get corrupted.\
  Please close the simulator or debug session first before you deploy files!\
  If there is a problem with the project file you can use the latest backup\
  which can be automatically created by the Deployer.\
\
- If ITM interface is used to communicate with the Target
  Debugger, the Monitor part must be executed in privileged
  mode.
 \
\
- The current implementation of the WSTMonitor causes restrictions
  regarding code roundtripping. It is planned to solve this issue
  in the near future. The WSTMonitor is required to communicate
  with the Embedded UML Target Debugger. 

  Currently the Target Debugger monitor part (C++ code on target)
  has problems to receive commands via Keil UVSOCK.
  When used in C++ code, the Keil UVSOCK interface seems to skip
  some bytes during data reception. Several Target Debugger features (e.g. query
  attributes, query states, suspend, set filters and breakpoints)
  may cause problems in the current C++ version.
