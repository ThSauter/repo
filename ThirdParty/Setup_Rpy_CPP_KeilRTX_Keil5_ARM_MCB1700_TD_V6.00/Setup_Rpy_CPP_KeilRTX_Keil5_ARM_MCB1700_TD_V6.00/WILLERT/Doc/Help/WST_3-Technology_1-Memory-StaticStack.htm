<h1><a name="Static_Stack" id="Static_Stack"></a>Using Static Stacks for active Classes</h1>
<br>
In many realtime embedded systems, you want to use static memory for your task stack. 
Normaly the stack is allocated from our RXF included memory pools or by using the std function malloc. 
But in some projects it is neccesary to work completly static which means, to have a static array in the *.c file in your generated code.<br>
<br>
To achief this goal we provide the stereotype "Task" as part of our RXF profile.<br>
This Stereotype can be adapted to an Object or Class as shown in the picture below.<br>
<img src="Images/StaticTaskStereotype.png"><br>
After setting the stereotype please make sure, that the following properties of the class / object are set correctly as shown in the picture below:<br>
<img src="Images/StaticTaskProperties.png"><br>
Please make sure that the properties CG::Class::ActiveMessageQueueSize and CG::Class::ActiveStackSize are overiden by your values. Additional make sure that the propertie CG::Class::StandardOperations is not overiden.<br>
After regenerating the code the *.c file includes two arrays "osw_msq" and "osw_stk" which are used for the message queue and the task stack.<br>
<br>
<b>Attention!!!</b><br>
Please notice that you can only create <b>one instance of the class</b> because the static array can not be used for more than one task at the same time.<br>
