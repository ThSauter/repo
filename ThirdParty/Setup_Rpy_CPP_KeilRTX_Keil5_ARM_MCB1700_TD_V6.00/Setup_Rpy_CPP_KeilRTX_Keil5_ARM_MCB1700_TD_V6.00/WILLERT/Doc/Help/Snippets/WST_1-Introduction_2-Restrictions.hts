<p>
<ul>

<li/>Roundtripping<br/>The current implementation of the WSTMonitor causes restrictions
  regarding code roundtripping. It is planned to solve this issue
  in the near future. The WSTMonitor is required to communicate
  with the Embedded UML Target Debugger.


<li/>Keil UVSOCK Communication from PC to Target<br/>
  
  Currently the Target Debugger monitor part (C++ code on target)
  has problems to receive commands via Keil UVSOCK.
  When used in C++ code, the Keil UVSOCK interface seems to skip
  some bytes during data reception. As a workaround all communication
  from Target Debugger (host) to C++ Monitor (target) is
  deactivated. Several Target Debugger features (e.g. query
  attributes, query states, suspend, set filters and breakpoints)
  are currently not available in the C++ evaluation version.
  We are in contact with Keil and trying to solve this problem
  with the Keil UVSOCK communication interface.
