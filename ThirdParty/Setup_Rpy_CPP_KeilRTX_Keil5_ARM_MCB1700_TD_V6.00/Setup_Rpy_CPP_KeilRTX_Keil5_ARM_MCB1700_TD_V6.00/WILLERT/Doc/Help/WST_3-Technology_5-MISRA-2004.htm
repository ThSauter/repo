Willert Software Tools GmbH has gone through great effort to adapt the
code in the RXF so it is MISRA 2004 compliant. If your application
must be MISRA 2004 compliant, you must set up your own MISRA compliance
process which can be based on our product plus MISRA 2004 specific
documents and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  In the sources of the RXF, excluding those of the Container Classes, you will find C comments which refer to MISRA 2004.
  These macros support two tools to ensure MISRA 2004 compliancy: QAC (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qa-systems.de/produkte/qa-c.html" target="_blank">www.qasystems.de</a>) and PC-Lint (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gimpel.com/html/pcl.htm" target="_blank">www.gimpel.com</a>).<br>
  <br>
  MISRA-C:2004 (4.4) states that in order to claim compliance with MISRA-C:2004 &nbsp;evidence must exist to show that:<br>

  <ol>
    <li>A compliance matrix has been completed which shows how compliance has been enforced.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>All of the C code in the product is compliant with the rules or is subject to documented deviations.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>A
list of all instances of rules not being followed is maintained, and
for each instance there is an appropriately signed-off deviation.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>The following issues have been addressed:&nbsp;

      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Training&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Style guide&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Compiler selection and validation&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Checking tool validation&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Metrics&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Test coverage<br></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>The framework is only MISRA compliant if the&nbsp;pre-processor macros NO_MALLOC and WST_PORTS_DISABLED are defined at compile time.<br>
