<a name="FILE_WST_1-Introduction_2-Restrictions"></a>

<h1><a name="Rectrictions" id="Rectrictions"></a>Product Restrictions</h1>The
Embedded UML RXF is adapted to seamlessly integrate into the
development environment toolchain. This requires several interfaces
which may result in restrictions which are not caused by the RXF
itself, but also the RXF has some restrictions.<br><br>
<h2><a name="UML_Restrictions" id="UML_Restrictions"><a name="Modelling_Restrictions" id="Modelling_Restrictions"></a>UML Modelling Restrictions</h2>
<p>
Almost all UML elements can be used in Rhapsody in combination with the RXF. This includes classes, objects, singleton objects, files,
statecharts, several kinds of relations etc. However, some UML elements
can not be used together with C code generation:<br>
<ul>
<li>Activity Diagrams associated to Operations<br>
  Code generation is only supported for activity diagrams and statecharts
  which are associated with a class, an object or a file. Activity
  diagrams can also be assigned to operations, but no C code can be
  generated from them.
</li>
<li>Ports<br>
  The usable ports are restricted to simple behavioural ports. Through
  these ports it is possible to send events from one object to another
  without a tight coupling meeting defined interfaces.<br>
  It is not recommended to send events through ports from an interrupt
  service routine, as memory will be dynamically allocated in that case.<br>
  Rapid Ports are supported, multicast ports are not supported and 
  switched of by the framework. Port multiplicity is supported.<br> 
</li>
  <li>Animation<br>
The RXF does not support communication via TCP/IP due to the
heavy overhead. As a consequence there is no support for Rhapsody's internal
feature called "Animation". But a good alternative is to use our animation
feature which allows debugging of real time applications: The
<a href="#FILE_WST_1-Introduction_9-UML-Target-Debugger">Embedded UML Target Debugger</a>.
</li>
<li>Inheritance<br>
To allow inheritance in the C language, all operations would need to be
implemented as callbacks or in a virtual function table. This would
increase the code size, RAM needs, runtime and calling operations from
user code would be more complicated. Thus no inheritance is available
in Rhapsody in C.</li>



</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="Target_Debugger_Restrictions" id="Target_Debugger_Restrictions"></a>Embedded UML Target Debugger Restrictions</h2>
<p>
<ul>

<li/>Roundtripping<br/>The current implementation of the WSTMonitor causes restrictions
  regarding code roundtripping. It is planned to solve this issue
  in the near future. The WSTMonitor is required to communicate
  with the Embedded UML Target Debugger.


<li/>Keil UVSOCK Communication from PC to Target<br/>
  
  Currently the Target Debugger monitor part (C++ code on target)
  has problems to receive commands via Keil UVSOCK.
  When used in C++ code, the Keil UVSOCK interface seems to skip
  some bytes during data reception. As a workaround all communication
  from Target Debugger (host) to C++ Monitor (target) is
  deactivated. Several Target Debugger features (e.g. query
  attributes, query states, suspend, set filters and breakpoints)
  are currently not available in the C++ evaluation version.
  We are in contact with Keil and trying to solve this problem
  with the Keil UVSOCK communication interface.


</ul>

  <p>The Embedded UML Target Debugger is a product developed by Willert Software Tools GmbH.
  It allows you to analyse the software behavior on target.
  This is similar to a conventional high level language debugger, but on UML level.
  This includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>live animation of sequence diagrams to trace the event order and state changes on target.</li>
  <li>live animation of embedded timing diagrams showing the events and state changes on a tick timer granularity timeline.</li>

    <li>see which instances of your objects which have a statechart have been created and destroyed.</li>

    <li>navigate through a model element tree to show attributes or the current state of a statechart for any instance.</li>

    <li>display the current values of the <a href="#FILE_WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-Management_High-Water-Marks">highwatermarks</a>.</li>

    <li>inject
events from the host-side and track the reaction of the target
(currently there are limitations for events with arguments).</li><li>see timeout events which have elapsed on target in the diagrams.</li>

    <li>monitor the elapsed time-ticks between two events.</li>
  </ul><img style="width: 800px; height: 565px;" alt="" src="Images/EmbeddedUMLTargetDebugger_800px.png"><br>
  <br>
It consists of a Windows application which let you control the
debugging and see the feedback from target and a monitor solution which
is part of the executable on target. <p>The Embedded UML Target Debugger has been designed with a
minimal overhead in footprint and disturbance of the behavior of your
model in mind. Therefore, most of the work is done at runtime on your
PC and as little as possible on your target. On the PC, you can view an
animated sequence diagram of your target live. The target only sends
very short messages when objects are created, destroyed or events are
being send. It also can react to commands from the host. The messages
and commands never contain symbolic data, but only memory addresses or
identification codes to keep the data size small. This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information used at startup of the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger on your PC.
    This information is stored in an XML file called <a name="XMLData.xml" id="XMLData.xml"></a>xmlData.xml.
This file is created using a simplifier helper
during Rhapsody's code generation</li><li>Information send from the target, like which
object has been created or destroyed, which event is send etc. For
sending information and receiving commands from the&nbsp;Embedded UML
Target Debugger on the PC, we need some interface. This can be a serial
interface but also CAN, JTAG or whatever I/O interface can be used. For
this example, we are working with a serial interface. But other
interfaces are available and you are free to implement whatever I/O you
like. A sample DLL interface for the host side is bundled with the
Embedded UML Target Debugger<br>
</li>
</ul>

  You can also use TestConductor in combination with Animation via an additional plugin.<br>

  <p>
The Embedded UML Target Debugger is part of
your product.

<a name="FILE_WST_2-Usage_1-Installation"></a>

  <h1><a name="Installation_of_Product" id="Installation_of_Product"></a>Installation</h1>The
installation of an RXF by Willert Software Tools requires you to already
have installed:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Your modelling tool IBM Rational Rhapsody </li>
  <li>The RTOS Keil RTX (RL-ARM)</li>
  <li>The compiler toolchain Keil MDK-ARM for Cortex-M3 including IDE.</li>
</ul>
A release of an RXF always comes with a Setup,
which needs to be executed in order to install the RXF. It will ask you
for some program paths, copy files, expand macros inside files and
configure all tools. Since each RXF is installed in a
separate directory, there is no need to make a backup of a previous
installation with an older version number.<br>
<br>
To install a product just launch <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup.exe</span> and follow the steps which are displayed.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 488px; height: 355px;" alt="" src="Images/Installation_SetupSteps02.png"><br>
<h2><a name="Installation_Problems"></a><a name="Setup_Problems"></a>Possible Problems During Setup</h2>
If you experience any problems, please first check the following possible solutions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have the necessary read/write access privileges in the destination directory or directories.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure you have enough disk space available.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Only Windows 7 and Windows 10 are supported operating systems.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Sometimes direct installation from or to a network drive, long source
path names and in rare cases directly from a DVD may cause problems. If
setup failed you may retry it after copying all files from the
installation folder (including "WILLERT" folder) onto a directory on
your local drive (e.g. "C:\Temp\WillertSetup\") and launching Setup.exe from there.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Setup will write an installation log file with helpful
information for our support team into the destination folder. It will
be named WST_Install_Log_<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;date&gt;</span>_<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;time&gt;</span>.txt.
If Setup can not access the specified destination path to write the log
file, it will show this error message and try to write it to drive C:
in the root directory:<br>
    <img style="width: 444px; height: 159px;" alt="" src="Images/Installation_Error_WritingProtocol0.png"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The "WILLERT" folder beside Setup.exe contains all the files that will be copied to your
installation directory. But it will perform several operations on them
during installation like macro expansions, conditional operations, path
replacements etc. So please don't copy any files from the WILLERT
folder contents to your destination directory manually, always use
Setup.exe.</li>
</ul>
If these possible solutions do not help, please contact our <a href="#FILE_WST_9-Support">support</a>, if possible including the log file.<br>
<h2><a name="Installation_Directory"></a>Contents of an Installation Directory</h2>

There are some files and a folder located beside Setup.exe. This section briefly describes what they are.<br>

<h2><a name="Multi-User_Setup"></a><a name="Installation_Path"></a>Multi-User Setup with Windows 7<br>
</h2>
When installing the RXF in Windows 7 the default paths for the Willert
folder is located under the user's homepath. It is recommended if a single user
should work on one PC with the RXF and makes sure read/write access to
that directory is no problem. But if multiple users on one machine
should work with the RXF, it is recommended to install the RXF and also
other toolchains (like IBM Rational Rhapsody and
Keil MDK-ARM for Cortex-M3) directly in a dedicated
directory on the hard disk's root. For exaple C:\Willert\ or
C:\Dev\Willert. This makes sure these folders are accessible for all
users on most setups.<br>

This
page will guide you through the first steps of using your product
Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00. The goal is to generate source code from an
included sample UML project with Rhapsody
<h2>Generating Code from the Rhapsody Model<br>
</h2>
<br>
<br>
Open the Rhapsody project Blinky from the directory
C:\Program Files\Willert\Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00\Samples\Model\BlinkyMultitasking:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 711px; height: 413px;" alt="" src="Images/RhapsodyOpenBlinkyModel.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Profiles"></a>The component <span style="font-style: italic;">TargetComponent</span>
is using the stereotype <span style="font-style: italic;">RXFComponent</span>&nbsp;which
is defined in the profile <span style="font-style: italic;">Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_Profile</span>.
Each RXF by Willert Software Tools comes with its own profile with the
stereotype <span style="font-style: italic;">RXFComponent.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">RXFComponent</span> sets the proper
environment, some properties for the RXF and defines some Tags. The
other profile referenced, <span style="font-style: italic;">WSTProfile</span>,
is used to set Rhapsody GUI details which makes it easier for you to
view and maintain your models.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ExamplePkg</span> contains the
following classes:<br style="font-style: italic;">
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">LED</span> which has an <span style="font-style: italic;">Init()</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">on()</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">off()</span> operation and a statechart to
react to events. 
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">SequentialController</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> has
a simple statechart which toggles the states on and off in an instance
of LED every 300 ms. </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ActiveController</span> has a
simple statechart which toggles the states on and off in another
instance of LED every 400 ms.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TestBuilder</span> is a
structured class which will instantiate the objects and link them (see
it's <span style="font-style: italic;">RunTime</span> structure
diagram).</li>
</ul>
<br>
You can now press the button "Generate/Make/Run" in Rhapsody (or use <span style="font-style: italic;">Generate/Make/Run</span> entry from <span style="font-style: italic;">Code</span> menu) to perform these steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Generate source files.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Rhapsody will show several generated .c and .h files along with
a .mak file in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Log</span> tab.</li>
    <li>A successful code generation will end with the log entries "<span style="font-style: italic;">Code Generation Done</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">0&nbsp; Error(s), 0&nbsp; Warning(s),
0&nbsp; Message(s)</span>".<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The build step in Rhapsody will actually generate configuration
files, the building of the executable will be performed inside
Keil uVision 5. Those configuration files are mainly:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>RhapsodyMake.bat to launch the WSTDeployer later on.</li>
    <li><a id="RxfDimensions.h" name="RxfDimensions.h"></a>RxfDimensions.h
which is an include file which contains constants which are derived
from properties set in the model like buffer sizes etc.<br>
These all deal with dimensions for the RXF, and because these are
inserted in an include file you do not need to set these constants in
your IDE later.</li>
    <li><a id="RxfConstants.h" name="RxfConstants.h"></a>RxfConstants.h
which sets constants with respect to the version of the RXF and its
configuration. Samples are <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_DEBUG_BUILDSET</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_RXF_V6</span>.</li>
    <li>WSTMemoryTypes.h which is used for <a href="#FILE_WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-Management">Memory Section
Management</a> so you can locate code and data exact where you like it.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>"Run" starts the WSTDeployer to bring all generated files into
your IDE.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

GettingStarted project along with the deployed files can be found in
this directory:
C:\Program Files\Willert\Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00\Samples\Code\GettingStarted.<br>
<br>
You may need to configure the debug settings to your
needs and hardware. Please check debugging settings carefully
(depending on Simulator Software or Debugger Hardware).<br>
<br>
<h3>Building the Target Executable</h3>
Now we can build the application and test it as usual with the
Keil MDK-ARM for Cortex-M3 Environment. Select to build your
GettingStarted project and verify the build was successful.<br>

  <p>The
Embedded UML Target Debugger is a product developed by Willert Software
Tools GmbH. It allows you to analyse the software behavior on target.
This is similar to a conventional high level language debugger, but on
UML level. This page will guide you through the first steps how to use
the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger.</p>To be able to work with the Embedded UML Target Debugger and view the target animation, &nbsp;please first go through the <a href="#FILE_WST_2-Usage_3-Getting-Started-1">GettingStarted example</a>.<br>
  <br>
<br>

  <h2>Basic Functionality - Getting Started with the Embedded UML Target Debugger</h2>For
the first steps with our Embedded UML Target Debugger, it is
recommended to use our example model instead of your own model. This
example will be based on IBM Rational Rhapsody as UML Tool. However the
steps and Target Debugger functionality when working with another UML
tool are very similar. We will use <a name="Blinky_UML_Sample_Model_with_Animation" id="OORTXAnimationDemo_Rhapsody_Sample_Model"></a>Blinky.rpy, which is a good starting point.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Also the EA Blinky sample model can be used.</span><br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody><tr><td style="width: 120px; vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">Please Note:</td><td><img style="width: 293px; height: 179px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_Filters_EnableTimeoutEvents.png" align="right">For
Enterprise Architect Users the Embedded UML Target Debugger initially
look like nothing is happening. After making sure the correct target
connection has been selected and the right XMLData.xml file is opened,
the only message received from the target is usually something like
"Monitor Version is : X.X.X". This is because the Blinky Sample Model
for EA just uses timeout-events and synchronous function calls instead
of events as messages. However you can easily make the timeout-events
visible in the Target Debugger by switching to the "Filters" tab on the
left side and check the checkbox to enable timeout-events.<br>
      <br>
 </td></tr></tbody>
</table>
<br><br>
  In your Rhapsody Model make sure to have the <a name="LiveAnimation_stereotype" id="LiveAnimation_stereotype"></a>LiveAnimation stereotype selected in addition to the RXFComponent stereotype for your active component.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">If you are using Enterprise Architect
you need to make sure the Animation Tag is set to "true" for your
configuration (this should be the default).</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
  <img style="width: 504px; height: 196px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationStereotypes.jpg"><br>
  <br>
Make sure you have an empty GettingStarted IDE&nbsp;project you can
deploy to. You can now perform a Generate/Make/Run in Rhapsody, which
will deploy the files to your IDE, and build the <a href="#FILE_WST_2-Usage_3-Getting-Started-1">GettingStarted example</a>.
After a successful build in your IDE, flash the executable to the
target but do not start program execution yet. The target program must
be reset and stopped. Otherwise the Embedded UML Target Debugger will
miss important information about dynamically created objects the target
sends.<br>
  <br> Now start the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger on
the PC. You can use the shortcut in the Windows Start menu to start the
UML Target Debugger. It which launch the batch file
located under &lt;Willert folder&gt;\&lt;your
product&gt;\Tools\TargetDebugger\Embedded_Uml_Target_Debugger.bat:<br>
  &nbsp;<img style="width: 526px; height: 227px;" alt="" src="Images/StartMenuLaunchAnimation1.jpg">

  <p><img style="width: 800px; height: 554px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationOpenXML1.jpg"></p><br>
  The Embedded UML Target Debugger first need to read the <a name="XML_file_for_animation" id="XML_file_for_animation"></a>XML
file which has been generated using a
simplifier helper during Rhapsody's code generation This file is called
XMLData.xml and located in the directory where
Rhapsody generates the code. You can open the XML file using <span style="font-style: italic;">File | Open XML File</span> or via button on the toolbar:&nbsp;

  <p><img style="width: 248px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationOpenXML2.jpg"></p><br>
After the XMLData.xml file was opened, you have to select the target
communication plugin you want to use from the drop down list. In the
next step you can select the communication parameters depending on the
communication interface. This example works with a serial
communication.<br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 208px; height: 127px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationSelectCommunication2.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 388px; height: 215px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationSelectCommunication3.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 202px; height: 70px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationSelectCommunication4.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  In retrospect it is always possible to change the communication plugin and settings by using the toolbar buttons:<br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 347px; height: 148px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationSelectCommunication1.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  

  
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="width: 120px; vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">Please Note:</td>

        <td>When working with&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keil µVision</span>, you can use the UVSOCK plugin which communicates with the target via JTAG:<br>
      <br>
Please activate it in Keil µVison's configuration dialog and configure the same
port number in µVision and the Embedded UML Target Debugger
communication interface settings (your port number may be different):<br>

      <br>

      <img style="width: 487px; height: 244px;" alt="UVSOCK configuration in Keil uVision" src="Images/TargetDebugger_Keil_uVision_Port_Config.png"><br>
</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  
</table>
<br>
  <br>
  The Embedded UML Target Debugger also allows you to add your own <a href="#FILE_WST_2-Usage_6-Target-Debugger_Custom-Communication-Interface">I/O interface implementation</a>.<br>
  <br>
Now it's time to shortly switch back to your IDE and start program
execution on target, as the Embedded UML Target Debugger now listens
for commands sent from target. In the tree view on the left you can now
also see values of attributes, states and highwatermarks.<br>
  You will see something like this:<br>
  <br>
  <img alt="" src="Images/EmbeddedUMLTargetDebugger_800px.png"><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h2>Advanced Features</h2>The Console window shows information on events: which object sends what
event to which destination object.<br>

<br>

You can also click on an attribute:
at that moment in runtime, the Embedded UML Target Debugger on the PC
will query the target to send the actual value - such information is
sent only on request by the PC in order to reduce the I/O traffic as
much as possible. The information shown on events is actually
transferred in a compact way and not as the strings you see, again to
reduce traffic and thus runtime disturbance.<br>
<br>
<h3>Timing Diagrams</h3>
The Embedded UML
Target Debugger is able to switch from the default sequence diagram
view to a timing diagram view. It is a useful diagram similar to the
timing diagrams known from technical data sheets to visualize state
changes proportional to the time axis.<br>

  <img style="width: 740px; height: 474px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_TimingDiagram1.png"><br>

  <br>

  Zooming in and out is possible using the mouse wheel, if available. You can also use the buttons of the zoom control panel:<br>

  <img style="width: 336px; height: 82px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_TimingDiagramZoom.png"><br>

It allows to enter the number of ticks to be displayed in the window,
zoom in and out and to specify a zoomed-in visible area by selecting
the "zoom box" tool and clicking twice into the diagram to specify the
timeframe to be shown / zoomed in. The auto refresh checkbox controls,
if the diagram should automatically scroll to the very right of the
diagram if new events have been received.<br>
<br>


  <h3><a name="Event_Injection_via_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger" id="Event_Injection_via_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger"></a>Event Injection</h3>Its
also possible to inject events by the Embedded UML Target Debugger.
This requires a right-click on the object to which the event will be
sent. In the appearing context menu any event can be selected. So its
possible to check out the reaction of the target, when the event is
received by the object.<br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 281px; height: 159px;" alt="" src="Images/EventInjection.jpg"><br>
  <br><a name="Events_with_Parameters"></a>Events may also have standard type
parameters, which are supported by the Embedded UML Target Debugger.
Parameters / arguments of events will be displayed as integer values
inside the animated diagrams. Also event injection with arguments is
possible. If you have selected to inject an event which has parameters
(defined in the UML model), a window will pop up and ask for each
argument. Currently only integer values are supported.<br>
<br>
This is a sample procedure of modifying an attribute via an event which has a parameter:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 483px; height: 162px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_EventParameters1.png"><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 365px; height: 128px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_EventParameters2.png"><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 153px; height: 107px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_EventParameters3.png"> Refreshing queried attribute values works by closing and opening the attribute display.<br>
<br>
This sample vied in the timing diagram looks like this:<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 360px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_EventParameters4.png"><br>

  <br>
<br>

  <h3><a name="Filtering_for_Specific_Instances_in_the_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger" id="Filtering_for_Specific_Instances_in_the_Embedded_UML_Target_Debugger"></a>Filtering</h3>On
a larger model, showing all events and attributes is confusing, because
it will not fit in a window and will lead to overhead. Therefore we
have implemented a filter which can show information for 8 objects as
maximum. Please select the Filter tab and enable a filter for the
itsProxy1 object (Proxy's first instance). Afterwards the button on the
toolbar to enable filter has to be pressed. <img style="width: 31px; height: 29px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebuggerToolbar_Filters.jpg" align="top"><br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody><tr><td style="width: 120px; vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">Please Note:</td><td>Filtering is disabled and will not work if the define <a name="WST_MONITOR_MINIMIZED"></a>WST_MONITOR_MINIMIZED is set. Also manual state queries are disabled in that case. </td></tr></tbody>
</table>
<br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 800px; height: 448px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_Filters1.png"><br>
  <br>
Now you can only see the events being sent by itsProxy. In the
screenshot you see the first events are also coming from itsActivator1,
but after the fifth event the filters have been enabled and only events
from itsProxy1 are displayed.<br>
  <br>
You can always&nbsp;change which classes or instances should be
animated, by checking and unchecking them in the tree view of your
model in the Filters tab.To apply the changes, it is necessary to press
the update filters button. <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebuggerToolbar_RefreshFilters.png"><br>
  <br>
  <a name="Timeout_Events_in_Target_Debugger" id="Timeout_Events_in_Target_Debugger"></a>The
animation of timeout events is also controlled in the filters tab, but
can be checked independent of the activated or deactivated filtering
mechanism.<br>
  <br>
 <h3>Serial Communication Buffer Overflows</h3>Interrupt based
serial communication, e.g. available for the ARM Cortex M3 Keil
environment, relies on send and receive buffers. When compiling the
monitor sources, the buffer sizes
and overflow behavior can be set via defines:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>If
WST_MONITORIO_WAIT is defined in the file WST_Product.h, the monitor
will&nbsp;wait until it can send data again,&nbsp;when the transmit
buffer is full. This way no event will get lost, but the real-time
behavior is being influenced on a full buffer.</li>

    <li>If
WST_MONITORIO_WAIT is not defined, events will get lost if the buffer
is full. In this case the buffer will be overwritten by new events. The
real-time behavior is not affected. In addition, the debugger is
informed that events may have been lost. This information is displayed
in the error window of the debugger.<br></li>
  </ul>The best solution
in such cases is to increase the value of SEND_BUFFER_SIZE in the
monitor I/O file, e.g. WSTMonitorIO_Keil_CortexM3_UART.h, if the
available RAM allows that.<br>
  <br>

  <h3><a name="Logging_Server_of_Target_Debugger" id="Logging_Server_of_Target_Debugger"></a>Logging Server</h3>The
Embedded UML Target Debugger has very open interfaces, also for the
Data which is being displayed. A built-in&nbsp;TCP/IP server can make
information about all received events and created or destroyed
instances available.&nbsp; This information is transformed by
the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger into string messages. Every
message begins with a type identifier and is send out as a block of
bytes ending with a new line ('\n').<br>
  <br>
  There are four message types implemented. Their type identifiers are::<br>

  <ul>
    <li>EVENT</li>

    <li>INIT</li>

    <li>DEST</li>
  <li>TIMEOUT<br>
  </li>

  </ul><br>
  The content parts of the message string are divided by a semicolon ('<span style="font-weight: bold;">;</span>').<br>All instance names are trailed by the depending class name divided with a colon ('<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span>').<br>
<br>
The following different message packages are supported:<br>
  <br>
  An Event occurred:<br>EVENT;&lt;event
name&gt;;&lt;source instance name&gt;:&lt;source class
name&gt;;&lt;destination instance name&gt;:&lt; destination class
name&gt;;&lt;elapsed ticks&gt;;&lt;current state name&gt;\n<br>
  <br>
A Timeout Event occurred:<br>
TIMEOUT;&lt;source instance name&gt;:&lt;source class name&gt;;&lt;elapsed ticks&gt;;&lt;current state name&gt;\n<br>
<br>
  A new instance is created:<br>INIT;&lt;instance name&gt;:&lt;class name&gt;\n<br>
  <br>
  An instance is destroyed:<br>DEST;&lt;instance name&gt;:&lt;class name&gt;\n<br>
  <br>
The logging server is running in the background of the Embedded UML
Target Debugger as a TCP server at the port 1234. There is no
possibility to communicate via this server with the&nbsp; Embedded UML
Target Debugger. The logging server only has the functionality to send
out information when something has happened on the target. Messages
sent to the server will be ignored. To check if the server has
started&nbsp;correctly and the client is connected correctly to the
server the two following lines must appear in the console tab of the
target debugger:<br>
  <img style="width: 317px; height: 106px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_Logger1.png"><br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Test_Server"></a><a name="Automated_Test"></a>Test Server</h3>
A test server with an open interface is part of the Embedded UML Target
Debugger. It can be used to inject events into the running target to
influence the behaviour of the target system. The injected event is
handled like a normal event. For injecting an event, the Target
Debugger's monitor is needed on the target side as part of the Willert
RXF framework. This additional software needs very little resources
(e.g. runtime depending on the used interface between host and target)
to execute the incoming data from the host to inject the event into
the framework.<br>
<br>
The built-in test server is reachable via TCP/IP on port 5050.<br>
<br>
Following information are needed about the event:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Instance name of the Source</li>
  <li>Instance name of the Destination</li>
  <li>Event name</li>
  <li>Event parameter</li>
</ul>
<br>
To inject an Event the information must be send to the test server as a string. This string has the following format:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;destination instance name&gt; &lt;event name&gt; &lt;source instance name&gt; [&lt;Parameter&gt;]\n</span><br>
<br>
The event parameter is actually implemented only as an int value and
only necessary if the injected event needs a parameter. If the injected
event needs a parameter and the transmitted string contains no
parameter the injected parameter for the event is autoset to 0 (zero).
All parameters must be divided with a space character (' '). It is also
possible to inject more than one event at a time. The injected string
must be extended with a second string of the same format. These two
strings must be divided with two semicolons ('<span style="font-weight: bold;">;;</span>') from each other, for example:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;destination instance name&gt;
&lt;event name&gt; &lt;source instance name&gt;
[&lt;Parameter&gt;];;&lt;destination instance name&gt; &lt;event
name&gt; &lt;source instance name&gt; [&lt;Parameter&gt;]\n</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
It is also possible to receive events with the test server:<br>
<br>
&#8220;&lt;event&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt; &lt;elapsed ticks&gt; &lt;current state&gt; [parameter];;&#8221;<br>
<br>
Every string is ended with two semicolons &#8220;;;&#8221;.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="User_defined_Types_in_Target_Debugger"></a><a name="UserTypes.xms"></a>User defined Types</h3>
The Embedded UML Target Debugger generally only supports displaying
attributes, event arguments etc. interpreted as integer types. But
attributes defined inside the UML model might also have different types
like e.g. user defined enumerations. In order to handle these
attributes and other attributes of the same class which follow behind
user defined attributes in the struct, the Target Debugger needs to
know their size in Bytes. The sizes are specified inside a
&lt;TypeList&gt; in <span style="font-family: monospace;">XMLData.xml</span>, but this file gets overwritten with
each building in the IDE. However it is supported to store an
XML-snippet file called "<span style="font-family: monospace;">UserTypes.xms</span>" in the IDE project directory
and specify user defined type sizes in this file to include those types
in every <span style="font-family: monospace;">XMLData.xml</span> generation and allow the Embedded UML Target
Debugger to visualize it and other attributes correctly. The values of
user defined types will also only be shown as integer values, like
usually 0 for the first literal of an enumeration, 1 for the second and
so on.<br>
<br>
Example enumeration type in the UML model:<br>
<img style="width: 389px; height: 185px;" alt="" src="Images/TargetDebugger_AttributeUserTypes0.png"><br>
<br>
Contents of user supplied 
XML-snippet file called "<span style="font-family: monospace;">UserTypes.xms</span>" in the IDE project directory:<br>
<pre><span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;Type size="4"&gt;SequentialController_status_t&lt;/Type&gt;<br>&lt;Type size="2"&gt;AnotherUserTypeSample_t&lt;/Type&gt;</span></pre>

If you experience strange problems with the Embedded UML Target
debugger, this could be caused by a non matching monitor version on
target. To make it easily possible to detect such problems, the error
log tab "Problems" will show Version conflicts in that case.<br>

  <h1>Communication Plugin</h1><br>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    This part will give an overview how to develop your communication interface between the target and the PC. This plugin allow the <a href="#FILE_WST_1-Introduction_9-UML-Target-Debugger">Embedded UML Target Debugger</a> on the PC to read and write data from / to the target board through different interfaces.
    You principally need to implement this part on the PC part (host) and the monitor part on target.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Embedded</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">UML&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Debugger Communication Interface.</span><br>
    <br>
    The Embedded UML Target Debugger needs to communicate with the target. This part is already implemented for a serial interface as an example. More ready to use interfaces might be available, you should contact Willert Software Tools for a list of currently available plugins. But it's also possible to implement a custom interface on your target and for Qt. You need to implement functions to initialize, read and write on you communication port. You need also to know how Qt works and more precisely the signal and slot concept.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;To implement the plugin, it's recommend to use QtCreator IDE to develop it. You can download it for free at <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">http://qt.nokia.com/downloads</a><br>
    <br>
    There is a template class available named "MyCommunicationPlugIn". You can rename this class for your convenience but you need to rename also the name in the Qt project file (.pro). You can see that this class implements Communication, a class interface that allow the Embedded UML Target Debugger to know which class can be called. You can not modify this class interface. Moreover you need to&nbsp;define those classes of the Communication interface. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;On MyCommunicationPlugin class, there are multiple functions:<br>

    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">void <span style="font-weight: bold;">initCom</span>()</span>:&nbsp; it needs to be implemented to initialize your communication plug in.
      You need to emit a signal to the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger to signal that the communication is ready.
      This should be done using communicationEstablished().</li>

      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">char* <span style="font-weight: bold;">read</span>() <span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span></span> inside this function, you need to insert a thread or event driven (preferable) functionality to read all available bytes from your communication port from the target.
      This function must write the number of bytes (numBytes) and the data (readBuffer).
      At the end you need to send the readBuffer and the number of bytes to the Embedded UML Target debugger via a signal (emit newCommand( readBuffer, numBytes )).</li>

      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">void</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">write</span><span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;">char[] , int length)</span> &nbsp;: this function&nbsp;is directly called from the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger and allow to write the data inside the&nbsp;table&nbsp;with the length of the table&nbsp;as second argument.
      This data must be send to the target via your communication interface.</li>

      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">bool</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">initialization</span><span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;">bool config)</span> :&nbsp;this function&nbsp;is directly called from the&nbsp;Embedded UML Target Debugger and initializes the config dialog box and the link between the dialog box view and MyCommunicationPlugin data model.
      In this function you can change the name and the list of parameter in .cpp and .h.
      You can also modify the slot function parameter to your own needs here.&nbsp;If you want to design the config dialog box you need to open the configdialog.ui file with QtCreator.&nbsp;If you click on the combo box, you can change on the right bottom hand side the object name, that you will call in the MyCommunication plugin with myDialogBox-&gt;getUi()-&gt;parameter1Box.
      So for each object, you want to edit in the CommunicationPlugin from configDiaolog.ui, you just need to check the objectName and call myDialogBox-&gt;getUi()-&gt; &lt; yourObjectName &gt; .
      Moreover, it's possible to add other boxes but you just need to connect them with the communication plugin like in the communicationPlugIn.cpp and add a slot function that calls it when the user changes it.</li>

      <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">void <span style="font-weight: bold;">close</span>() :</span> Needs to be implemented to close MyCommunicationPlugIn..</li>

  <h1><a name="FAQ_Animation" id="FAQ_Animation"></a>Animation FAQ</h1>This page is supposed to answer questions related to the Embedded UML Target Debugger and animation generally.<br>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#Animation_does_not_work">Why do I not see any animation</a> - there is no error shown.</li>

    <li>The application on the PC shows "<a href="#COM1_not_found">Can not find COMx</a>" on the error tab.</li>
  <li>The communication between the <a href="#Keil_uVision_Target_Debugger_Interface">Target Debugger and Keil µVision</a> does not work. <br>
  </li>

  </ul><br>
  <br>

  <h4><a name="Animation_does_not_work" id="Animation_does_not_work"></a>Why do I not see any animation - there is no error shown.</h4>There are two obvious reasons for this:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>Did you use the stereotype LiveAnimation from your product's <a href="#Profiles">profile</a> in your Component in Rhapsody?<br></li>

    <li>Did you <a href="#XML_file_for_animation">open the XML file</a> in the animation program on the PC and is there no error message?<br></li>

    <li>Did the generate / make / run in Rhapsody show any problems? Usually you should see something like this at the end:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<img style="width: 711px; height: 92px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationRhapsodyBuildOutput1.jpg"><br></li>

    <li>Also in your IDE you usually see some kind of message about the creation of the XML file. There should not be error messages.<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 800px; height: 88px;" alt="" src="Images/AnimationIDEBuildOutput1.jpg"></li>
  </ul><br>
  <br>

  <h4><a name="COM1_not_found" id="COM1_not_found"></a>Can not find COMx</h4><img style="width: 199px; height: 65px;" alt="" src="Images/WindowsCOM0B.jpg"><br>
  <br>
You can use the communication setup dialog to configure&nbsp; the COM
port which should be used. You can also check your Windows system
settings and configure the number to be used for your serial port.<br>

Buildsets (Debug / Release)</h1>
It is very likely that you want to distinguish between optimized
production code, and code you want to debug. For this, your product
supports two buildsets, as defined in the property <span style="font-style: italic;">C_CG::Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6_00::</span><span style="font-style: italic;">BuildCommandSet</span>.<br>
<br>
The main difference is the defines which will be generated into
RxfConstants.h.<br>
The Debug Buildset will define <span style="font-family: monospace;">_DEBUG</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">HIGHWATERMARKS</span> per
default, while Release will define <span style="font-family: monospace;">NDEBUG</span>. This is because the
Rhapsody generated makefile will use one of the properties <span style="font-style: italic;">CPPCompileDebug</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">CPPCompileRelease</span> inside the <span style="font-style: italic;">CPPCompileSwitches</span> property.<br>
<br>
These resulting <span style="font-style: italic;">CppCompileSwitches</span>
should include <span style="font-weight: bold;">-D&lt;macro
definition&gt; options only</span>. The reason for this, is that you
build your application in your IDE. That is where you specify for
example include paths and other options. The options or macros set via the property <span style="font-style: italic;">CppCompileSwitches</span> result in
#defines in a generated RxfConstants.h when you select <span style="font-style: italic;">Code&nbsp;|&nbsp;Build</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Code&nbsp;|&nbsp;Rebuild</span> in
Rhapsody.<br>

<h1><a name="WSTDeployer"></a><a name="IDE_Integration"></a>WSTDeployer
- Deploying Files to the IDE Environment<br>
</h1>
Willert Software Tools RXF products come with the tool WSTDeployer
which is used to integrate generated files and the RXF into an existing
build environment, typically the IDE. The usual approach is the
following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Code is being generated by IBM Rational Rhapsody.</li>
  <li>If the WSTDeployer is started for the first time for an
environment it will display a configuration dialog where the
destination Keil uVision 5 project needs to be specified.</li>
  <li>The WSTDeployer copies the generated files to the destination
folder where the IDE project is located.</li>
  <li>The WSTDeployer copies required RXF files to the destination
folder.</li>
  <li>For some IDEs the WSTDeployer also modifies the project by adding
the deployed files automatically, see table below.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of Building Sources Inside the IDE</h2>
Instead of building your application within
IBM Rational Rhapsody or just via makefile, your application is
build inside Keil uVision 5 where all knowhow is available on
target derivates, memory maps and even boards, simulator-, debugger-
and emulator specifics. Your IDE may come with a Wizard and your tool
manufacturer will have provided extensive documentation on how and
where to tweak settings in the IDE to accomplish some setting.<br>
<br>
In order to build your application in Keil uVision 5, the
IBM Rational Rhapsody generated sources must be available
inside an IDE project. You can either use a product or an adaptation
which supports a Deployer to copy all generated files to an IDE project
and also update the IDE project file so all your sources will show up
in the IDE or integrate files in the IDE project manually. To prevent
you from having to specify various constants which are used in the RXF,
the code generation process will generate a few include files - one for
configuring the size of queues for example, and another include file
for defining constants used in the RXF (for details see <a href="#WSTProduct.h">here</a>).
What you must do yourselves is specify include paths and of course as
usual, make sure the correct startup files, device configuration files
and settings are part of the IDE project.<br>
<br>
The Deployer is a separate application which
is launched when you select Run in Rhapsody. You will use:<br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Code | Generate</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Code | Regenerate</span> to generate your
application sources</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Code | Build</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Code | Rebuild</span> to generate the
necessary include files (with defined constants)</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Code | Run</span> to launch the
Deployer</li>
</ol>
or use the G/M/R button to perform all this with one click.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note</span>: The WSTDeployer
needs to access the Rhapsody API to get model specific information.
Rhapsody only allows API connections to the Rhapsody instance which was
first started. This means only one running Rhapsody application at a
time is recommended when working with the WSTDeployer. After a crash or
Rhapsody, please make sure no orphaned instance is still listed in the
system's task manager.<br>
<br>
<h2>Deployment Configuration</h2>
The WSTDeployer does not save the location of the IDE project to deploy
to inside the IBM Rational Rhapsody model, but stores this
information in the local registry to allow different users working on a
model to have different IDE locations. The Keil uVision 5
project file location is configured when
the WSTDeployer is running in configuration mode. This is the case if
no destination project for the current environment has been configured
yet or if the Deployer configuration is opened manually. This is
possible via a Tools menu entry in
Rhapsody. <br>
<br>
<img style="width: 530px; height: 200px;" alt="" src="Images/DeployerConfig1.png"><br>
<br>
In the configuration dialog please use the "..." button to browse to
your IDE project, for the first steps this is usually the
GettingStarted project which can be found in <small>"@WILLERT_1@\@WST_RELEASE_NAME@\Samples\Code\GettingStarted"</small>
on your machine. You need to select the ".uvprojx" file.<br>
<br>
<a name="RXF_Library"></a><a name="Dimensioning_Files"></a>If the
checkbox "RXF Library is used" is checked, you need to build a library
from the RXF sources and make sure that library is included in the IDE
project manually. It will make sure the WSTDeployer does not add RXF
files except a few dimensioning files which should not be part of the
RXF library, but should be part of the IDE destination project. These
dimensioning files are WST_CFG.c, WST_MEM.c, WSTTarget.c and possibly
additional product specific ones.<br>
<br>
<a name="WST_MAX_TIMEOUTS"></a>
Please note: WST_TMM_Init uses a modelling tool generated #define for
the maximum timeouts. Changing this value in the modelling tool
requires a recompilation of the RXF library.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Registry_PAth_used_by_WSTDeployer"></a> The place where
environment
specific configurations are saved by the WSTDeployer is the windows
registry under this path:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\</small><br>
<small>Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\de\willert\deployer\</small><br>
<small>Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00\<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
&lt;current
model name&gt;</span></small><small>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;current
component name&gt;</span></small><small>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;current configuration name&gt;</span></small><small><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>"</small>.<br>
</div>
This means the destination IDE project configuration is saved specific
per environment, model name, active component name and active
configuration.<br>
<br>
Actually for technical reasons the model,
component and configuration names are not exactly known when calling
the WSTDeployer, so they are extracted from the generated sources
directory&nbsp; (via <a href="#WSTDeployer_Command_Line_Arguments">setSourceDir</a>)
which it expects in the following format to extract the information
correctly from the path: "...\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;model
name&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;active
component&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;active
configuration&gt;</span>".
In Rhapsody this would be the default, but the configuration's path can
be changed to a user defined one. This is no problem and still the
WSTDeployer will work well, it will use just the deepest three
directory levels of the generated source directory as its key for the
registry.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note</span>: Features listed as
not supported for
Keil uVision 5 in this table may limit the actual
functionality described below.<br>
<h2><a name="WSTDeployerLog.txt"></a>Deployment Log File</h2>
In the WSTDeployer directory (<small>"@WILLERT_1@\@WST_RELEASE_NAME@\Tools\WSTDeployer"</small>)
a log file WSTDeployerLog.txt will be created and each run of the
deployer appends information, warnings and errors about the deployment.
If the WSTDeployer is started with the debug command as first argument,
also debugging information is written to the log file. <br>
<br>
The log file&nbsp;WSTDeployerLog.txt is limited to a size of 512kB. If
the size is exceeded, the file will be renamed to a backup log file
named WSTDeployerLog.txt.1 and a new WSTDeployerLog.txt will be
started. If an older WSTDeployerLog.txt.1 already existed, it will be
truncated. This makes sure the log files never consume more than 1MB of
hard disk space. <br>
<h2><a name="WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt"></a><a name="Excluding_Files_from_Deployment"></a><a name="Target_Adaptations_using_WSTDeployer"></a>Setting
up a Project Specific WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt</h2>
The WSTDeployer can also use individual settings, which files to
deploy, for a specific IDE project. This is helpful, if an environment
specific file, e.g. WSTTarget.c should not be copied from the product's
Sources directory, but will be generated from the model or is included
manually in the IDE project.<br>
<br>
To override the general&nbsp;exception lists WSTDeployerExcludedFiles<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lib</span>.txt
and&nbsp;WSTDeployerExcludedFiles<span style="font-weight: bold;">NoLib</span>.txt
(in the directory <small>"@WILLERT_1@\@WST_RELEASE_NAME@\Tools\WSTDeployer"</small>),
you need to place a file WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt in a project
specific directory. There are two possibilities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Place&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt</span>
in your IDE project directory. This is the directory also containing
the IDE project you specify in the WSTDeployer configuration dialog. </li>
  <li>Place&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt</span>
in your generated sources directory.<br>
This is typically under the component's
directory: <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;path of your Rhapsody
model&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;component
name&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;configuration
name&gt;</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The individual deployment exception list must not contain the
postfix <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lib</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">NoLib</span> in the filename, it is just
named WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt.</li>
  <li>The
IDE project or configuration specific exception lists
WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt are not merged by the WSTDeployer with the
general product one and no default lists get added dependent on the <span style="font-style: italic;">RXF Library is used </span>Checkbox. They
just override all other lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Including_External_Files_via_WSTDeployer"></a><a name="WSTDeployerAdditionalFiles.txt"></a>Using the WSTDeployer to
Copy Additional Files<span id="BugEvents"></span></h2>
Similar to the WSTDeployerExcludedFiles.txt mechanism, the WSTDeployer
can also use individual settings to specify additional files which are
not generate by IBM Rational Rhapsody but should be copied and
included in the Keil uVision 5 project. This mechanism is
meant to include e.g. legacy code in the deployment process. It is not
meant to include external libraries in the IDE project, this should be
done directly in Keil uVision 5.<br>
<br>
A general (and usually empty) additional deployment file list is
located in <small>"@WILLERT_1@\@WST_RELEASE_NAME@\Tools\WSTDeployer"</small>
and called WSTDeployerAdditionalFiles.txt. This file can be edited to
specify RXF product wide additional files
or you need to place a WSTDeployerAdditionalFiles.txt file in a project
specific directory. Again, there are two possibilities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Place&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">WSTDeployerAdditionalFiles.txt</span>
in your IDE project directory. This is the directory also containing
the IDE project you specify in the WSTDeployer configuration dialog. </li>
  <li>Place&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">WSTDeployer</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Files.txt</span>
in your generated sources directory.<br>
This is typically under the component's
directory: <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;path of your Rhapsody
model&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;component
name&gt;</span>\<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;configuration
name&gt;</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The IDE project or configuration specific additional file list
WSTDeployerAdditionalFiles.txt is not merged by the WSTDeployer with
the general product one.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Clean_Redundant_Source_Files"></a><a name="Removing_Files_from_IDE_Project"></a><a name="CurrentFileList.txt"></a><a name="PreviousFileList.txt"></a><a name="Roundtripping"></a><a name="Model_Code_Associativity"></a>Removing
Files from the IDE Project after Renaming or Deleting Model Elements<br>
</h2>
The Deployer may support removing files from the IDE project
(Keil uVision 5: supported).&nbsp;
IBM Rational Rhapsody will remove redundant source files which
have been deleted or renamed in the model or which are not inside the
active component's scope anymore. When these files are deleted from
file system in the generated sources folder and have already been
deployed to the IDE earlier, those files will automatically be removed
from your deploy destination folder. Depending on the features of your
WSTDeployer IDE adaptation, it can also remove those files
automatically inside the Keil uVision 5 project. You can also
deactivate this feature in the <a href="#WSTDeployer.properties">WSTDeployer.properties</a>
file by changing
PrjRemoveRedundantSourceFiles to false.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note</span>:
In Rhapsody the user has to manually
trigger the deletion of generated files by the Rhapsody code generator.
This is done in the "Code" menu via "Clean Redundant Source
Files"<br>
<br>
You can set the Deployer to deploy files to the same directory as
IBM Rational Rhapsody generates them. That way the deployer
will not perform the copy operations but keep the files in
Keil uVision 5 up to date. You need to use this way of working
with the Deployer to be able to use Rhapsody's roundtripping mechanisms.<br>
<br>
WSTDeployer may use files called CurrentFileList.txt and
PreviousFileList.txt inside the generated sources directory. Those
files are reserved to be used by the WSTDeployer to support removal of
redundant source file links from IDE projects.<br>
<h2><a name="Relative_Paths_for_the_Deployer"></a>Working with a
Relative Root Path</h2>
It is possible to specify the root path of your destination IDE project
not just as an absolute path (which is usually done via the "..."
browse button), but manually enter a relative path. It is not possible
to enter any relative path just like "..\IDE_Project" or "IDE_Project".
Instead if a relative path should be used it must begin with a single
point-backslash: "<span style="font-weight: bold;">.\</span>", so the
two examples would need to be entered as ".\..\IDE_Project" and
".\IDE_Project". The path will be relative to the generated sources
directory.<br>
<h2><a name="Backups_of_IDE_project_files"></a>Backups of
Keil uVision 5 Project Files</h2>
The WSTDeployer by default creates up to three Backups of the
Keil uVision 5<br>
project file. The backups will only be created if the last backup is
more than one hour old. Backups will be named including the date and
time e.g. GettingStarted.uvproj.Backup_2012-08-01_17-45-33.&nbsp;You
can also deactivate this feature in the <a href="#WSTDeployer.properties">WSTDeployer.properties</a> file by
changing PrjAutoBackup to false.<br>
<h2><a name="Command_Line_Arguments_of_the_WSTDeployer"></a><a name="WSTDeployer_Command_Line_Arguments"></a>Using WSTDeployer from
the Command Line</h2>
To enable <a href="#Automated_Builds">automated build</a> scripts etc., it may be useful to be able to
control the WSTDeployer via the command line.<br>

  <h1><a name="RXF_Migration"></a><a name="V5_to_V6_Migration"></a>Migration from a V5 Product to V6</h1>The
RXF is currently available in major version 6. It allows Willert
Software Tools to create more customized product releases based on an
internally used, highly modular component structure. But also on the
customer side migration from a V5 product to V6 involves several
changes and improvements.<br>
<h2><a name="Modelling_Tools"></a>Modeling Tool Support<br>
</h2>
Until V5 all products have been adapted for the UML tool Rhapsody by
IBM Rational. There were only two V5 releases ("EA_Bizet" and
"EA_ez430") which were manually created for Enterprise Architect by
Sparx Systems. V6 allows to encapsulate modelling tool specifics in a
modelling specific component and makes it possible to support multiple
UML tools with code generators just as we support a wide range of
RTOSes, compilers and targets. <br>
<h2><a name="Programming_Language"></a>Programming Language Support</h2>
The support for non-ANSI-C products are been improved. The V6 of the
Willert RXF will also be available also for C++ in the near future.<br>

<h2><a name="Footprint_of_the_V6_RXF"></a><a name="Code_Size_of_the_V6_RXF"></a><a name="ROM_needs_of_the_V6_RXF"></a><a name="PEPS_of_the_V6_RXF"></a><a name="OORTX_vs_RTOS"></a>RTOS based RXF<br>
</h2>
The RXF used in combination with an RTOS is now completely switched
over to the RXF which already has been used for a long time together
with the OO-RTX by Willert Software Tools. This gives us a much better
performance in RTOS based products. But the biggest difference is the
footprint. Our V6 Multitasking RXF with Keil RTX reduces the code size
by about <span style="font-weight: bold;">60%</span>!<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
(e.g. Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>While V5 products have always
been names after classical composers like Beethoven, Hã­¤el, Strauss or
Monteverdi, in V6 we now use product codes which are more technical and
not as easy to vocalize. They consist of all important component names
(in short form) a product has been built for. This is the big benefit
of the new product codes, you can always see what is part of a product
and what will be the difference between two installed environments.<br>
Product codes are put together following this scheme:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Modelling Tool</td>
      <td>Programming Language</td>
      <td>RTOS</td>
      <td>Compiler</td>
      <td>Target</td>
      <td>Evaluation Board*</td>
      <td>Extension**</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
An RXF Product is adapted to each of these components. The components
have short names (like EA for Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect or Rpy
for IBM Rational Rhapsody). For the product name the components are put
together in the order shown above, each separated by an underscore. <br>
* The Evaluation Board component may not be part of a product. It is
usually responsible for allowing LEDs to blink in a sample project on
the actual board or even to specify which CPU of a CPU family the
product can be used with. E.g. for "Keil_ARM" there are preconfigured
products available for the ARM7 board "Keil MCB2130" and the ARM
Cortex-M3 board "Keil MCB1700".<br>
** Extensions are optional and multiple extensions may be combined in
on product. Possible extensions are "TD" for Embedded UML Target
Debugger or&nbsp; "Eval" for an evaluation version of the RXF.<br>
<h2><a name="Version_Numbers"></a>Version Numbers<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
In version 6 releases always have a version number like V6.xx, no minor
revision separated by an "r" like in V5 is used anymore. But The new
release mechanism now also allows to create custom releases which might
have a postfix appended to the version name, e.g. "_beta" for beta
versions or "p1" for a patch which has been applied to the&nbsp;latest release. <br>
<h2><a name="Installed_Files"></a>Installed Files<br>
</h2>
V5
RXF products were installed completely into the Rhapsody directory
structure (&lt;Rhapsody&gt;\Share\WST_RXF_V5\&lt;RXF release name&gt;).
Now, with our modelling tool independent approach, RXF files are
installed in a "Willert" directory at a location of your choice. On
Windows XP it is no problem to put this folder under "C:\Program
Files". For Windows 7 it is recommended to use a directory inside the
user path, as write permissions to several files under this path are
required. To hook into Rhapsody, only
Rhapsody's Site&lt;language&gt;.prp file is adapted, tool menu entries
might be added and the product's profile is copied to the Rhapsody
Profiles folder.<br>

<h2><a name="Tags_for_WSTDeployer"></a>WSTDeployer<br>
</h2>
The WSTDeployer is now more independent of the modelling tool. In V5 it
used to access tags set inside the component to know e.g. the name of
the IDE project file. The WSTDeployer configuration was then used to
just select the path where the file can be found. V6 does not access
tags inside the model anymore and asks to browse to the IDE project
file instead of its directory.<br>

<h2><a name="Libraries_in_V6"></a><a name="RXFD"></a><a name="RXFR"></a><a name="CreateRXFLibrary_in_V6"></a>Libraries<br>
</h2>
Evaluation releases of the RXF do not contain source code of most of the RXF files.
They come with precompiles libraries (usually located under Source\LIB
and named RXFD.&lt;lib&gt; and RXFR.&lt;lib&gt;).<br>
All full product versions do not come with a library and most of them
are not prepared to be used with the RXF in a library. In V5 the first
steps for a user of non-evaluation product were always to build the IDE
projects "CreateRXFLibrary" and eventually "CreateAnimationLibrary" for
both, Debug and Release, buildsets. This is not necessary anymore, the
WSTDeployer option, if a library should be used here, is now disabled
by default. Source files of the RXF will be deployed into your IDE
project and built along with your generated application code. This has
several advantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>First steps are easier.</li>
  <li>The problem of an updated compiler without recompiled libraries
is gone. If the user first build the RXF libraries, then later updates
the compiler and tries to link strange errors, sometimes even during
runtime may occur. We experienced such problems via related support
requests.</li>
  <li>Defines such as WST_CFG_HIGHWATERMARKS 
are now more comfortable, because the libraries do not need to be
recompiled with the defines which have been set in the current UML
model configuration.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
With todays compilers and linkers there are mostly no differences in
code size, because unused functions are deleted by the optimizer no
matter it it comes from a library or a source code/object file.<br>

<h2><a name="Container_Classes"></a><a name="List"></a><a name="WST_CON_LST"></a><a name="Map"></a><a name="Hash_Map"></a><a name="Collection"></a><a name="Set"></a><a name="Abstract_Data_Types"></a>Container Classes</h2>
UML models may contain relations between classes which are not 1-to-1
relations, but which have a multiplicity. If the multiplicity is a
fixed value, the relation can be realized via a simple array by the
code generator. But it it is a "1-to-*" or "*-to-*" relation the
relation must be managed dynamically via an implementation of container
classes. Depending on other settings of the relation, like it it is
ordered and it it has a key parameter for accessing it, container
classes like a collection, list or map are required.<br>
<br>

Your product is delivered with the full Rhapsody specific container classes
RiCList, RiCMap and RiCCollection. Other V6 products may come with a V6
specific own container class called WST_CON_LST, which is not available
in your release.<br>
<br>
<h2>Sending Events</h2>
The RXF V6 allows to send asynchronous messages / events via the macros
FIRE, FIRE_ISR and includes macros for easy
handling of static event arrays to be used in interrupt service
routines. For details please see the <a href="#FILE_WST_3-Technology_6-Asynchronous-Messages">asynchronous messages</a> help section.<br>

You may use the Windows control panel functionality to remove installed
software from your machine. Willert products can be removed one by one
this way. After all product specific files have been removed by the
Willert uninstaller during a guided deinstallation procedure, only the
folder C:\Program Files\Willert\Uninstall will stay on your system. It contains
information about all products and the associated deinstallations that
have been installed on your machine. You may remove the whole
C:\Program Files\Willert folder after deinstalling <span style="font-style: italic;">ALL</span> Willert products from your machine.

  <h1><a name="Memory_Section_Management" id="Memory_Section_Management"></a>Memory Management: Allocating Sections<br>
</h1>Your
toolchain will most probably put code in ROM as well as string
literals, but you might want to fine-tune the location where specific
code and data to meet your physical resources.<br>
  <br> If you do
not specify anything in C sources, a default allocation scheme will be
used by your locator. However, most toolchains allow you to use
compiler pragmas which define the start and end of a
certain&nbsp;section. The locator can be instructed to allocate these
sections at a specific address: in combination with the&nbsp;memory
layout of your hardware you are able to locate specific code and data
exact where you want it.<br>
  <br>
The source code of the OO RTX is for most parts common for any RXF we
release; apart from the target, compiler and RTOS adaptations the very
same code is processed by many different compilers and excecuted in a
wide variety of CPUs. We therefore implemented macro constants, which
indicate the start and end of some section. The actual translation
towards a compiler or toolchain specific pragma is done in a toolchain
specific include file, which is part of this product release.<br>
  <br>
  The macros and their corresponding implementation of the toolchain specific pragmas offer:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>the memory categories:&nbsp;OORTX, OSAL, APPL</li>

    <li>the phases:&nbsp;ONPOWER, DOWNPOWER, SLEEP, RUNNING</li>

    <li>for code: CODE</li>

    <li>for data sizes: 8 (bits), 16 (bits), 24 (bits), 32 (bits), UNSPECIFIED (bits)</li>

    <li>for data types:&nbsp;INIT, NOINIT, CONST</li>

    <li>for memory types: FAST, SLOW<br></li>
  </ul>When
you setup a macro scheme which supports the above, you will end up with
an impressive list of macros which results in a long include file
WSTMemoryTypes.h where the corresponding compiler pragmas are defined.
So we actually generate this WSTMemoryTypes.h using two input files:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>a file which defines the memory categories, running phases, code and data types and memory types</li>

    <li>a file which defines the toolchain specific compiler pragmas for these</li>
  </ul>The
file WSTMemoryTypes.h which is generated using this input, is included
in both the generated source files and the RXF source files. After
linking your application, you can inspect the resulting memory map. You
must instruct your locator where to place all sections if you want to
override its default behavior.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

<h1><a name="Realtime_compliant_Dynamic_Memory_Management" id="Realtime_compliant_Dynamic_Memory_Management"></a>Realtime
Compliant Dynamic Memory Management</h1>
<br>
In many realtime embedded systems, the use of dynamic
memory management via the standard C library functions malloc() and
free() is not wanted. Moreover, in certain secure environments you are not allowed to
use those functions. The main reason for not using heap functions is
fragmentation: after allocating and freeing chunks of memory, the heap
gets cluttered with areas which are in use, and areas which are free
and it becomes more and more difficult to find a suitable area for some
object or structure which must be allocated at runtime. Another
reason is that the standard functions are not real-time compliant,
calling them at the same time from different threads will cause errors.<br>
<br>
Instead of using the heap, the RXF offers static pools for various
purposes the size of the blocks and the number of blocks can be configured using properties.:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a static pool for events. The size of this pool can be specified
in your UML model and its usage can be monitored via <a href="#FILE_WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-Management_High-Water-Marks">high
water marks</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>a static pool for timeouts. Each tm() you are specifying in your
UML model results in a timeout structure which is kept in a static
pool. The size of this pool can be specified and its usage can be
monitored via a high water mark.</li>
  <li>three static buffer pools; one for small-, for medium- and large
chunks. The number of elements in each pool as well as the size of a
small, medium and large block can be configured. The usage of the pools
can be monitored via high water marks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Configuration of the values is done via properties inside Rhapsody.
These properties can be found under subject
and metaclass C_CG::Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6_00 and should be set
preferably on component level:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTTinyBufferSize">WSTTinyBufferSize</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTSmallBufferSize">WSTSmallBufferSize</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTMediumBufferSize">WSTMediumBufferSize</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTLargeBufferSize">WSTLargeBufferSize<br>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTHugeBufferSize">WSTHugeBufferSize<br>
    <br>
</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTInitialTinyBuffers">WSTInitialTinyBuffers</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTInitialSmallBuffers">WSTInitialSmallBuffers</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTInitialMediumBuffers">WSTInitialMediumBuffers</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTInitialLargeBuffers">WSTInitialLargeBuffers<br>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTInitialHugeBuffers">WSTInitialHugeBuffers<br>
    <br>
</a></li>
<li><a href="#Property_WSTMaxTimeouts">WSTMaxTimeouts</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<a name="BaseNumberOfInstances" id="BaseNumberOfInstances"></a> If you
want to prevent the use of these pools, you should override the
property&nbsp;CG::Event::BaseNumberOfInstances so it has no value.<br>
However, there is a more elegant way to achieve this:
You can set any of the Initial{Size}Buffers Properties to 0, the framework will then
automatically remove all use of this specific block.</size>
<br>
In the profile which comes with your product, we have provided a
stereotype called StaticComponent, which sets certain properties in
Rhapsody to use the dynamic memory functions of the RXF which work
on the three buffer pools. Next to that, any call to malloc() and
free() is mapped onto the appropriate equivalent via macros which are
included in the generated sources and RXF.<br>
<br>
When allocating a chunk, the function which operates on the buffer
pools tries to allocate the chunk in the pool which matches the size
needed. This way we try to prevent fragmentation.<br>
<h2>Events</h2>
The pool for the events is actually a pool for pointers to events: the size
of an event will vary depending if you are using arguments in events.
So the pointer array is allocated statically. The events itself are
allocated in the buffer pools: depending on any object you allocate
dynamically you might want to fine-tune the size of the elements in the
small buffer to the size of your largest event.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Timeouts</h2>

The timeouts are stored in their static pool. Because the size of a timeout
structure is always the same, the pool itself holds the timeouts. A
timeout is actually translated into an event: the timeout structure
itself remains in the timeout pool, but its address is inserted in the
event (pointer) pool.<br>
Setting the TimeoutBuffers to 0 will cause the framework to remove all timer
code and thus be much smaller.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<a name="Mixed_Mode_Static_and_Dynamic_Memory" id="Mixed_Mode_Static_and_Dynamic_Memory"></a>You may use singletons
in your UML model or use the three static pools
(small, medium and large buffers) for allocation of your objects. It is
also possible to use a mixture of static and dynamic memory:&nbsp; you
can disable the definition of NO_MALLOC, which prevents the memory management
of the RXF from calling malloc(), when a static buffer pool is
exhausted. If you inspect the memory map file created by the linker
(verify the settings in your IDE to create one), you can calculate the
size of your objects &nbsp;- provided you start with static allocated
objects - and see if you can fine-tune the dimensions of your three
static buffer pools. You can use the high water marks to verify how
much these are used at runtime.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="NO_MALLOC" id="NO_MALLOC"></a><a name="Mapping_malloc_and_free" id="Mapping_malloc_and_free"></a><a name="realloc_undefine" id="realloc_undefine"></a><a name="calloc_undefine" id="calloc_undefine"></a><a name="malloc_mapping" id="malloc_mapping"></a><a name="free_mapping" id="free_mapping"></a><a name="WST_DO_NOT_MAP_MALLOC" id="WST_DO_NOT_MAP_MALLOC"></a>Mapping malloc() and free()</h2>
If
you have defined NO_MALLOC&nbsp;(e.g. by selecting the StaticComponent
stereotype), malloc() and free() will be mapped to WST_MEM_getMemory()
and WST_MEM_returnMemory(). This means also if you use malloc() and
free() in your user code, these will be mapped to the static pools. You
should check you map file in your project to be sure, malloc and free
are not used anymore.<br>
Please note: Mapping of realloc is currently not supported, because the
stdlib.h function just needs pointer and new size as arguments, but
WST_MEM_reallocMemory expects three arguments: the pointer, current
size and new size. Also calloc is not being mapped.<br>
<br>
If you want to work with NO_MALLOC defined but need to deactivate the
mapping of malloc() and free(), make sure to define the
macro&nbsp;WST_DO_NOT_MAP_MALLOC.<br>
<br>
<a name="realloc undefine"></a><a name="calloc undefine"></a>If WST_DO_NOT_MAP_MALLOC is not defined, but NO_MALLOC or WST_MAP_MALLOC is set, we
undefine realloc and calloc in file WST_MEM.h. For some
compilers this helps to make sure these functions can not be used and
will lead to an error message or warning at compile time. But please
note that other compilers will handle the function declaration
differently and #undef realloc / #undef calloc will not generate a
warning or an error.<br>

  <h1><a name="High_water_marks" id="High_water_marks"></a>High Water Marks</h1>
All static buffers can be configured via properties which you can set
in your model. We have implemented high water marks for these so you
can inspect at runtime how much resources of these buffers are actually
used.<br>
  <br>There is a single data field which you can inspect for the high water marks. This field is a structure which shows:<br>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>the maximum number of buffers used of the small buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of&nbsp;buffers used of the medium buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of&nbsp;buffers used of the large buffer pool</li>

    <li>the maximum number of timeouts used of the timeout buffer pool</li>

    <li>a flag which indicates if the heap was used because a buffer pool was exhausted, in the case you enabled a <a href="#Mixed_Mode_Static_and_Dynamic_Memory">mixed mode of static and dynamic memory</a> management.</li>
  </ul>The high water marks allow you to fine-tune the number of elements provided in the static pools.<br>
<br>
They are enabled if <a href="#WST_CFG_HIGHWATERMARKS_Define">WST_CFG_HIGHWATERMARKS</a>
is defined, usually this can be done via the generated file
RxfConstants.h. Then you can add the global structure "highwater" to
your debugger's watch window to analyze the high water marks after a
system has performed the desired tasks.<br>

<!-- CONTENT FROM FILE WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-StaticStack.htm -->
<a name="FILE_WST_3-Technology_1-Memory-StaticStack"></a>

<h1><a name="Static_Stack" id="Static_Stack"></a>Using Static Stacks for active Classes</h1>
<br>
In many realtime embedded systems, you want to use static memory for your task stack. 
Normaly the stack is allocated from our RXF included memory pools or by using the std function malloc. 
But in some projects it is neccesary to work completly static which means, to have a static array in the *.c file in your generated code.<br>
<br>
To achief this goal we provide the stereotype "Task" as part of our RXF profile.<br>
This Stereotype can be adapted to an Object or Class as shown in the picture below.<br>
<img src="Images/StaticTaskStereotype.png"><br>
After setting the stereotype please make sure, that the following properties of the class / object are set correctly as shown in the picture below:<br>
<img src="Images/StaticTaskProperties.png"><br>
Please make sure that the properties CG::Class::ActiveMessageQueueSize and CG::Class::ActiveStackSize are overiden by your values. Additional make sure that the propertie CG::Class::StandardOperations is not overiden.<br>
After regenerating the code the *.c file includes two arrays "osw_msq" and "osw_stk" which are used for the message queue and the task stack.<br>
<br>
<b>Attention!!!</b><br>
Please notice that you can only create <b>one instance of the class</b> because the static array can not be used for more than one task at the same time.<br>
<br>

<h1><a name="Deterministic_Realtime_Reaction" id="Deterministic_Realtime_Reaction"></a>
  Deterministic Realtime Behavior
</h1>

Deterministic here does not imply fixed-sequence polling.
Although this is possible too, the RXF uses a different method to achieve a deterministic behavior.
The RXF serves your generated application.
It will provide services like sending and receiving events, setting and handling timers and more.
<br>

<h2><a name="Managing Events"></a>
  How Events are processed.
</h2>

When an event is sent, the framework will store that in a queue where
it will be handled as soon as possible. The handling of events is also
done by the framework. Handling events also means handling expired
timers that are converted to events when they expire.
<br><br>
An event for a specific object will be given to the generated event
handle function of the Objects Class. This function carries out all the
associated actions (On Entry, On Exit, in State, in Transitions) and
will return the control to the framework when finished.
<br><br>
This will guarantee a flawless handling of events in a deterministic
way. Actions can be delayed by other actions but only for a time that
can easily be calculated. Actions that require hard real-Time can be
safely moved to the interrupt level without loss of performance or
design capabilities.
<br><br>
Actions are not pre-emptive and cannot be interrupted by other tasks.
Interrupts are not disabled or disabled for a maximum of 4 instruction
cycles (depending on the CPU). The RTOS based RXF (offering a full OSAL
implementation) is of course designed to preserve all RTOS capabilities.
<br>

<h2><a name="Managing Timouts"></a>
  How Time-outs (tm(xx) ) are handled.
</h2>
When the tm(xx) statement is used in a stae-machine,
the user wants a certain delay in the processing of states.
tm(xx) in a transition means: Wait at least xx milliseconds
and then take this transition (and execute all attached actions)
<br><br>
The timer ticks are derived from a system tick that is either implemented
in the framework (By using a hardware timer)
or by using the timer ticks from an operating system.
Both ways have a limit to the minimal time that can be used.
If the timer tick is 10ms then no timeout can be under 10ms.
Also no timeout should be other then a multiple of 10.
<br><br>
When this happens to be the case, the framework calculates the correct
timout value.
Due to the fact that the timer is derived from an external tick source,
it is possible that a timeout request occurs
just before a tick would happen or just after a tick has happened.
The granularity of the ticks is the minimum tick value.
This means that using a tm(10) on a 10 millisecond tick system can
give you a tick time between 10ms and 20ms.
<br><br>
[tm(0)] will always expire when the next tick is there. (so maximum of 10mS)
[tm(1)] will always expire at the second next tick (so 10ms-20ms later)
[tm(2) - tm(10)] will give the same result as a tm(1)
tm(11) - expires after 20ms-30ms
and so on.
So the parameter in tm(xx) indicates the MINIMUM time to pass before
the transition is taken!
<br>
<h2><a name="NULL_Transitions"></a>
  NULL-Transitions in a State Machine.
</h2>
In a statechart it is possible to model state transitions which are
directly to be taken, without waiting for an event as a trigger. These
are so called NULL-transitions. The RXF includes a mechanism to detect
endless loops of NULL-transitions (e.g. because of a design error in
modelling a state machine) during runtime. An endless loop is detected,
if more than a defined number of NULL-transitions occur in a row. This
maximum number of directly following NULL-transitions can be configured
in WST_FSM.h via define WST_DEFAULT_MAX_NULL_STEPS.

  <h1><a name="Power_Management" id="Power_Management"></a>Power Consumption Management</h1><br>
  
  The
RXF products support a function WSTRTOS_Sleep() as part of its RTOS
Interface. By default, this function is empty but you can implement
your own functionality here which highly depends on your application
and hardware. The function WSTRTOS_Sleep() is called when the OO RTX
has nothing to do, but the heartbeat will continue, which is mostly
implemented as an interrupt service routine from a timer or via an RTOS.<br>

  <br>

<a name="FILE_WST_3-Technology_4-Error-Handling"></a>

<h1><a name="Error_handler" id="Error_handler"></a>Error Handling</h1>
Runtime errors in the RXF or OO RTX are handled by the error
handler <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_ERR_error()</span>.
The error handler will catch use of NULL pointers, lack of resources,
etc.<br>
<br>
The error handler function is called from several places in the Framework, the first argument
indicates the error that occured, the second parameter is not always used but for instance
in case of an RTOS failure, te RTOS error code is passed here.
<br>
<br>
The function <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_ERR_error()</span>&nbsp;is&nbsp;implemented
as an endless loop in the source file WST_ERR.c. It is strongly
recommended to modify WST_ERR.c and provide your own error handler
implementation which fits your application needs.<br>
<br>
You can modify the error handler in several ways:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Modify the source file Source\WST_ERR.c
so your version will be used in any generated application for that product.<br>
</li>
  <li>Copy the source file \Source\WST_ERR.c
to your working directory and add it to your model, so its contents can
be made specific for your model or project.</li>
  <li>Insert the source file into your UML model. This way you can maintain it in
a central place and use it in various projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed List of Enumerated Error Codes</h2>The error code names
are mostly self explaining and mostly used only in one or few places in
the RXF code. I you are manually debugging your code on source code
level it is recommended to look at the error code and use the call
stack feature or your debugger to examine when has caused the error.<br>

  <h1><a name="MISRA_2004_compliancy" id="MISRA_2004_compliancy"></a>MISRA 2004 Compliancy</h1><br>
Willert Software Tools GmbH has gone through great effort to adapt the
code in the RXF so it is MISRA 2004 compliant. If your application
must be MISRA 2004 compliant, you must set up your own MISRA compliance
process which can be based on our product plus MISRA 2004 specific
documents and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  In the sources of the RXF, excluding those of the Container Classes, you will find C comments which refer to MISRA 2004.
  These macros support two tools to ensure MISRA 2004 compliancy: QAC (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qa-systems.de/produkte/qa-c.html" target="_blank">www.qasystems.de</a>) and PC-Lint (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gimpel.com/html/pcl.htm" target="_blank">www.gimpel.com</a>).<br>
  <br>
  MISRA-C:2004 (4.4) states that in order to claim compliance with MISRA-C:2004 &nbsp;evidence must exist to show that:<br>

  <ol>
    <li>A compliance matrix has been completed which shows how compliance has been enforced.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>All of the C code in the product is compliant with the rules or is subject to documented deviations.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>A
list of all instances of rules not being followed is maintained, and
for each instance there is an appropriately signed-off deviation.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>The following issues have been addressed:&nbsp;

      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Training&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Style guide&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Compiler selection and validation&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Checking tool validation&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Metrics&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Test coverage<br></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>The framework is only MISRA compliant if the&nbsp;pre-processor macros NO_MALLOC and WST_PORTS_DISABLED are defined at compile time.<br>
  <br>

<h1><a name="Event_Handling"></a><a name="CGEN"></a><a name="RiCGEN"></a><a name="FIRE"></a><a name="Messages"></a>Asynchronous Messages<br>
</h1>
The Willert RXF supports communication via asynchronous messages, also
known as events. This is a strong mechanism for decoupling object
oriented software in run time behavior.<br>
<br>
Event receptions in a UML model are usually consumed by classes which
have their behavior modelled via a statechart. An event can for example
be perfectly used to trigger a transiton to another state.<br>
<br>
Events can be sent from any part of the application, usually within
user code. The RXF supports different macros to send an event to a
receiving object:<br>

<h1>Properties</h1>
<h2>RXF specific Properties for Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6.00</h2>
Product specific properties are organized under the property subject
and metaclass C_CG::Rpy_CPP_KeilRTX_Keil5_ARM_MCB1700_TD_V6_00. Rhapsody properties are
hierarchically organized and may be overridden in deeper hierarchical
elements, e.g. on active configuration level inside the Rhapsody UML
model. The definition of product specific properties is contained in
the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">@WILLERT_1@\ @WST_RELEASE_NAME@\ Config\UserSettings\WST_RXF_V6.prp</span>.

<h1><a name="Defines used inside the RXF"></a>List of RXF Defines</h1>
<br>
The RXF can be configured and tailored to the specific needs of an
application by setting specific #defines.<br>
<br>
There are three typical places used to set defines:<br>

there is no other way to answer your model specific questions than
looking at the model ourselves. If you may not send your model, the
model is too complex to easily describe when it goes wrong or if
special hard- and software is required for reproduction, you should
consider creating a tiny example model that lets you reproduce the same
problem and send the tiny one.</li>
