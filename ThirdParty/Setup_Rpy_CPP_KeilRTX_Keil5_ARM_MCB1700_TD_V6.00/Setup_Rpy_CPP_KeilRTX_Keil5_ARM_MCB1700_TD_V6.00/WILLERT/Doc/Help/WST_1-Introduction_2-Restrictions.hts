  <li>Task Suicide<br>
Active objects can only be destroyed by other objects (murder). Suicide of an active object (e.g. via the state chart's termination connector) is not supported. Reason: Dynamically allocated stack memory can not be returned. KeilRTX API has limitations, there is no simple solution to implement suicide.
